  division `\`, exponentiation `^` and remainder `mod`;
- as well as functions: sine `sin`, cosine `cos`, tangent `tan`,
  arcsine `asin`, arcosine `acos`, arctangent `atan`, natural logarithm `ln`,
  decimal logarithm `log` and square root `sqrt`;
- as well as an arbitrary number of parentheses `()`;
